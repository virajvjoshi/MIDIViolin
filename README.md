# MIDIViolin
For Project 'IMI', Resistive Touch "Linear Soft Pots" meets Processing and MIDI outputs, Physical Computing, Audio Processing

** Application of minim audio library for Processing along with resistive touch "linear soft pots" for Arduino. **
IMI is a MIDI instrument derived from the form factor of a Violin to allow an intuitive & fluent interface for violinists.In a market crowded by MIDI players shaped like keyboards or arrays of buttons, someone who's world view of music is through the interface of a violin has to adopt to a completely new interface to record and edit digital tracks. IMI is a solution aimed at that market.

This application explores Processing for:
01. Minim audio library
02. Making Strings and Arrays
03. Arduino to Processing Serial Port connection
04. Playing specific music notes on serial command from Arduino

This application explores Arduino for:
01. Control of Resistive Touch Sensors "Linear Soft Pots"
02. Arduino to Processing Serial Port connection
